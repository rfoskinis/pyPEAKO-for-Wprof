Installation
=========================

pyPEAKO can be installed on any system running Python 3.6 or higher (because there are lots of f strings in the code).
In the future, pyPEAKO will be available from the Python Package Index (PyPI), which enables easy installation via pip:


.. code-block:: console

   (env)$ pip install pypeako

In the meantime, installation has to be done manually via cloning from GitHub:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/ti-vo/pyPEAKO

Then navigate to the main folder (pyPEAKO) and install the package in your current environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd pyPEAKO
   $ pip install -e .
